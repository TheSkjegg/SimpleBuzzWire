# Simple Buzz Wire
This repo holds the code and wiring diagram to build a simple Arduino Buzz Wire game with timer and high score as shown in this video: <YT link>

Following parts are required:
  1. Some break or copper pipe (4,7mm diameter)
  2. Some copper wire for the start/stop pads and ring/handle (ca 1,7mm diameter)
  3. Seeed Studio XIAO SAMD21
  4. 8 digit 7segment LED display
  5. Regular 5mm red LEDs
  6. Resistors as defined in wiring diagram
  7. Passive buzzer (f.ex ABT-402-RC)
  8. 3D printed parts, as shared here: <printables link>

  Note: The code relies on following library's:
  LedControl
  FlashStorage (as the SAMD21 does not have EEPROM)

  Game on!
